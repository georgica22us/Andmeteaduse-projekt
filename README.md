# Project A18: KAGGLE-RED WINE QUALITY
This project is a part of the course Introduction to Data Science. 

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro
The purpose of this project is to is to take large amounts of raw data and produce valuable actionable insights. 
We would also like to find out which variables affect the outcome of wine quality more or less. Correlation between columns will be found.
Lastly the plan is to create an algorithm which is best suitable to predict the quality of red wine.

### Methods Used
* Data Visualization and analysis
* Machine Learning
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Pandas, jupyter
* HTML

## Project Description
In this project, we used data about red wine from kaggle. The original dataset consisted of 1599 different red wines with 11 different variables and outcome (wine quality) about all of them. 
Our goals for this project were to first of all see how all the different variables impact quality and then train a model to predict wine quality based on variables. 
Another minor goal was to bring out the values for each variable that together should get the best quality score.

## Getting Started
