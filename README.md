# Project A18: KAGGLE-RED WINE QUALITY
This project is a part of the course Introduction to Data Science. 

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro
The purpose of this project is to is to take large amounts of raw data and produce valuable actionable insights. 
We would also like to find out which variables affect the outcome of wine quality more or less. Correlation between columns will be found.
Lastly the plan is to create an algorithm which is best suitable to predict the quality of red wine.

### Methods Used
* Data Visualization and analysis
* Machine Learning
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Pandas, jupyter
* HTML

## Project Description
In this project, we used data about red wine from kaggle. The original dataset consisted of 1599 different red wines with 11 different variables and outcome (wine quality) about all of them. 
Our goals for this project were to first of all see how all the different variables impact quality and then train a model to predict wine quality based on variables. 
Another minor goal was to bring out the values for each variable that together should get the best quality score.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open this repo with Jupyter notebook.
3. The main code is written in files K채tlin.ipynb, Maria.ipynb and Georg.ipynb.
4. To run these files, in each you have to run all cells from beginning.

### Notebooks contents:

#### K채tlin.ipynb:
* Relation between Chlorides and quality
* Relation between Density and quality
* Relation between Sulphates and quality
* Relation between Free sulfur dioxide and total sulfur dioxide
* Relation between Free sulfur dioxide and quality

#### Maria.ipynb:
* Relation between Volatile acidity and quality
* Relation between Fixed acidity and quality
* Relation between pH and quality
* Relation between Citric adic and quality
* Relation between residual sugar and quality
* Relation between fixed acidity and volatile acidity
* Relation between fixed acidity and pH
* Relation between volatile acidity and pH
* Relation between citric acid and pH
* Best and worse wine comparison

#### Georg.ipynb  + Project.ipynb:
* Realtion between alcohol and quality
* Correlation
* Prediction using KNN and RFC
